      <description>This paper proposes and tests the hypothesis that common ownership of nearby firms, which I call geographic common ownership, incentivizes firms to internalize environmental externalities. Using US EPA Toxic Release Inventory data from 1987 to 2019, I find that facilities sharing significant common institutional ownership with nearby firms tend to release fewer toxic chemicals, compared to other facilities of the same parent firm. An analysis using mergers of financial institutions as a quasi-natural experiment suggests that the effect of geographic common ownership on toxic pollution is causal.</description>

      <title>Who Do You Vote For? Same-Race Voting Preferences in Director Elections</title>

      <description>This paper examines racial preferences of shareholders in the context of corporate director elections. We document a higher propensity of mutual fund managers to vote for director nominees who match their racial or ethnic identity. This same-race preferential voting pattern is more prevalent in elections involving nominees receiving negative recommendations from the dominant proxy advisor ISS. We investigate various potential channels &amp;ndash;statistical discrimination, value maximization, conflicts of interest, social networks, and taste-based biases&amp;ndash; using high-dimensional fixed effect models along with heterogeneity tests.</description>

      <title>Active Mutual Fund Common Owners&#39; Returns and Proxy Voting Behavior</title>
      <link>https://yegeorge.com/research/co-and-return/</link>

      <description>We find that active mutual funds owning product market competitors have superior risk-adjusted returns that are not driven by industry concentration, common selection, or stock picking ability. These funds charge higher fees but also generate persistent net-of-fee returns for investors. Funds with higher common ownership are more active voters who are more likely to vote against executive incentives compensation and for directors with existing directorships in competitors. Our findings suggest some actively-managed mutual funds have an incentive to soften product market competition and that proxy voting could serve as one mechanism for influencing corporate policy.</description>
