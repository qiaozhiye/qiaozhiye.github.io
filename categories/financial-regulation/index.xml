      <description>We investigate the motivations and effectiveness of corporate lobbying by analyzing public firms&amp;rsquo; comment letters on the SEC&amp;rsquo;s proposed governance-related rules. We find that public firms predominantly submit pro-management comment letters and that these firms are often associated with weaker governance characteristics. Notably, public firms&amp;rsquo; letters are more likely to be cited in final rules and lead to material changes aligned with their positions &amp;mdash; particularly when advocating for pro-management changes.</description>

      <description>By using unique hand-collected project-level investment data on Chinese private investments in public equity (PIPE) issuances, we show that the length of the regulatory approval process for equity issuance is positively related to the probability of subsequent changes in equity-financed projects and a deterioration in project returns. The effects are more pronounced for firms in a highly competitive industry and with a comparative disadvantage. Furthermore, we show that this relationship is causal by exploiting the exogenous shock to approval delay caused by changes in the Chairman of the China Securities Regulation Commission.</description>
