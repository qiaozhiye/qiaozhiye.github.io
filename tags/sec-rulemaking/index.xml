      <description>We investigate the motivations, effectiveness, and shareholder-value implications of public firms&amp;rsquo; attempts to influence the SEC&amp;rsquo;s governance-related rulemaking. Our analysis leverages large language model-assisted text analysis and citation tracking to examine comment letters submitted during the rulemaking process. We find that public firms predominantly submit pro-management comment letters and that these firms are often associated with weaker governance characteristics. Notably, public firms&amp;rsquo; letters are more likely to be cited in final rules and lead to material changes aligned with their positions particularly when advocating for pro-management changes.</description>
