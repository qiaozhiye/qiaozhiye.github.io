      <description>We investigate the motivations and effectiveness of corporate lobbying by analyzing public firms&amp;rsquo; comment letters on the SEC&amp;rsquo;s proposed governance-related rules. We find that public firms predominantly submit pro-management comment letters and that these firms are often associated with weaker governance characteristics. Notably, public firms&amp;rsquo; letters are more likely to be cited in final rules and lead to material changes aligned with their positions &amp;mdash; particularly when advocating for pro-management changes.</description>
