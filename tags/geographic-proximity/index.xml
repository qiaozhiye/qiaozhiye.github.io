      <description>This paper proposes and tests the hypothesis that common ownership of nearby firms, which I call geographic common ownership, incentivizes firms to internalize environmental externalities. Using US EPA Toxic Release Inventory data from 1987 to 2019, I find that facilities sharing significant common institutional ownership with nearby firms tend to release fewer toxic chemicals, compared to other facilities of the same parent firm. An analysis using mergers of financial institutions as a quasi-natural experiment suggests that the effect of geographic common ownership on toxic pollution is causal.</description>
