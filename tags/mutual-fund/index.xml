      <description>This paper examines racial preferences of shareholders in the context of corporate director elections. We document a higher propensity of mutual fund managers to vote for director nominees who match their racial or ethnic identity. This same-race preferential voting pattern is more prevalent in elections involving nominees receiving negative recommendations from the dominant proxy advisor ISS. We investigate various potential channels &amp;ndash;statistical discrimination, value maximization, conflicts of interest, social networks, and taste-based biases&amp;ndash; using high-dimensional fixed effect models along with heterogeneity tests.</description>
