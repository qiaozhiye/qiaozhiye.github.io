      <title>Comments that Count: How Corporate Lobbying Shapes Governance Regulations</title>

      <description>We investigate the motivations and effectiveness of corporate lobbying by analyzing public firms&amp;rsquo; comment letters on the SEC&amp;rsquo;s proposed governance-related rules. We find that public firms predominantly submit pro-management comment letters and that these firms are often associated with weaker governance characteristics. Notably, public firms&amp;rsquo; letters are more likely to be cited in final rules and lead to material changes aligned with their positions &amp;mdash; particularly when advocating for pro-management changes.</description>

      <title>Internalizing Environmental Externalities Through Geographic Ownership Networks</title>
      <link>https://yegeorge.com/research/co-and-pollution/</link>

      <description>We propose and test the hypothesis that ownership connections between collocating firms facilitate the internalization of environmental externalities. Using the US EPA Toxic Release Inventory data from 1987 to 2019, we find that facilities sharing significant common institutional ownership with nearby firms tend to release fewer toxic chemicals, compared to other facilities of the same parent firm. An analysis using mergers of financial institutions as a quasi-natural experiment suggests that the effect of geographic common ownership on toxic pollution is causal.</description>

      <title>Who Do You Vote For? Same-Race Voting Preferences in Director Elections</title>
      <link>https://yegeorge.com/research/race-and-voting/</link>

      <description>This paper highlights racial and ethnic preferences in corporate director elections. We discover that mutual fund managers are more likely to vote for director nominees who share their racial or ethnic identity, using a comprehensive dataset of mutual fund voting records. Funds managed by all-white teams exhibit the strongest same-race preference, particularly those in fund families with scarce minority representation. In contrast, minority fund managers exhibit such preference only when voting on candidates nominated to boards with little or no existing minority director representation.</description>

      <title>Active Mutual Fund Common Owners&#39; Returns and Proxy Voting Behavior</title>

      <description>Active equity mutual funds owning shares in product market competitors have higher risk-adjusted returns, even after fees. This positive association comes from their common ownership positions, and remains robust after controlling for industry concentration, common stock selection, and the tendency to invest in firms with more common ownership. These funds charge higher fees and are active voters: more likely to vote against executive pay-for-performance and for directors with existing directorships in competitors.</description>

      <title>Are Employees Informed? Evidence from Employee Stock Ownership in Defined Contribution Pension Plans</title>

      <description>This paper investigates the return predictability and information content of changes in employee ownership of own-company stock in defined contribution pension plans. Using the US Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Form 5500 data from 2000 to 2019, I find that a two-standard-deviation increase in the changes in employee stock ownership in a year is associated with a 2.2-to-2.5 percentage point increase in employersâ€™ annualized abnormal returns in the subsequent year. The results are robust to both regression and portfolio sorting approaches, alternative return measures, and controlling for firm characteristics and reported insider trading activities.</description>

      <title>Missing the Boat: Regulatory Approval Delay and Investment Project Outcomes</title>

      <description>By using unique hand-collected project-level investment data on Chinese private investments in public equity (PIPE) issuances, we show that the length of the regulatory approval process for equity issuance is positively related to the probability of subsequent changes in equity-financed projects and a deterioration in project returns. The effects are more pronounced for firms in a highly competitive industry and with a comparative disadvantage. Furthermore, we show that this relationship is causal by exploiting the exogenous shock to approval delay caused by changes in the Chairman of the China Securities Regulation Commission.</description>
