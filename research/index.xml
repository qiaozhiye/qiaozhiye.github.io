      <description>This paper proposes and tests the hypothesis that common ownership of nearby firms, which I call geographic common ownership, incentivizes firms to internalize environmental externalities. Using US EPA Toxic Release Inventory data from 1987 to 2019, I find that facilities sharing significant common institutional ownership with nearby firms tend to release fewer toxic chemicals, compared to other facilities of the same parent firm. An analysis using mergers of financial institutions as a quasi-natural experiment suggests that the effect of geographic common ownership on toxic pollution is causal.</description>

      <title>Who Do You Vote For? Same-Race Voting Preferences in Director Elections</title>

      <description>This paper examines racial preferences of shareholders in the context of corporate director elections. We document a higher propensity of mutual fund managers to vote for director nominees who match their racial or ethnic identity. This same-race preferential voting pattern is more prevalent in elections involving nominees receiving negative recommendations from the dominant proxy advisor ISS. We investigate various potential channels &amp;ndash;statistical discrimination, value maximization, conflicts of interest, social networks, and taste-based biases&amp;ndash; using high-dimensional fixed effect models along with heterogeneity tests.</description>

      <title>Active Mutual Fund Common Owners&#39; Returns and Proxy Voting Behavior</title>

      <description>We find that active mutual funds owning product market competitors have superior risk-adjusted returns that are not driven by industry concentration, common selection, or stock picking ability. These funds charge higher fees but also generate persistent net-of-fee returns for investors. Funds with higher common ownership are more active voters who are more likely to vote against executive incentives compensation and for directors with existing directorships in competitors. Our findings suggest some actively-managed mutual funds have an incentive to soften product market competition and that proxy voting could serve as one mechanism for influencing corporate policy.</description>

      <title>Are Employees Informed? Evidence from Employee Stock Ownership in Defined Contribution Pension Plans</title>

      <description>This paper investigates the return predictability and information content of changes in employee ownership of own-company stock in defined contribution pension plans. Using the US Department of Labor&amp;rsquo;s Form 5500 data from 2000 to 2019, I find that a two-standard-deviation increase in the changes in employee stock ownership in a year is associated with a 2.2-to-2.5 percentage point increase in employersâ€™ annualized abnormal returns in the subsequent year. The results are robust to both regression and portfolio sorting approaches, alternative return measures, and controlling for firm characteristics and reported insider trading activities.</description>

      <title>Missing the Boat: Regulatory Approval Delay and Investment Project Outcomes</title>

      <description>By using unique hand-collected project-level investment data on Chinese private investments in public equity (PIPE) issuances, we show that the length of the regulatory approval process for equity issuance is positively related to the probability of subsequent changes in equity-financed projects and a deterioration in project returns. The effects are more pronounced for firms in a highly competitive industry and with a comparative disadvantage. Furthermore, we show that this relationship is causal by exploiting the exogenous shock to approval delay caused by changes in the Chairman of the China Securities Regulation Commission.</description>
